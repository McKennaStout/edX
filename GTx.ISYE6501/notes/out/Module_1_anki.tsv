Module 1 — Analytics	"Definition (plain): Analytics is using data to answer questions and make better choices.

Definition (formal): Analytics is the use of data, models, and computation to support better decisions and understanding.

Support:
- I'm Joel Sokol, Director of the Master of Science in Analytics degree at Georgia Tech and a professor in Georgia Tech's Stewart School of ISYE.
- In my research and consulting, I've used analytics in a lot of different ways to help a lot of different people.
- In almost all of that work, a critical key to success has been analytics modeling."
Module 1 — Descriptive analytics	"Definition (plain): Descriptive analytics tells you what happened.

Definition (formal): Descriptive analytics summarizes what happened using reporting, aggregation, and visualization."
Module 1 — Predictive analytics	"Definition (plain): Predictive analytics predicts what will happen.

Definition (formal): Predictive analytics uses historical data to estimate or forecast unknown outcomes.

Support:
- Analytics can also answer predictive questions, questions that ask what's going to happen in the future."
Module 1 — Prescriptive analytics	"Definition (plain): Prescriptive analytics tells you what to do to get the best result.

Definition (formal): Prescriptive analytics recommends actions by optimizing objectives under constraints.

Support:
- On the left is a stream of models, lots of different mathematical approaches to solving analytics problems, machine learning, regression, optimization, and many others sprinkled with examples and situations where they're each valuable."
Module 1 — Supervised learning	"Definition (plain): You learn from examples where the right answer is already known.

Definition (formal): Supervised learning learns a mapping from inputs (features) to known outputs (labels) using labeled examples."
Module 1 — Unsupervised learning	"Definition (plain): You find patterns without being told the right answers.

Definition (formal): Unsupervised learning finds structure in data without labeled outcomes (e.g., clustering)."
