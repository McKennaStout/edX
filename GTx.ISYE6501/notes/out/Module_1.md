# Module 1 — Key concepts

## Analytics

- Definition (plain): Analytics is using data to answer questions and make better choices.
- Definition (formal): Analytics is the use of data, models, and computation to support better decisions and understanding.
- Support (professor phrasing):
  - I'm Joel Sokol, Director of the Master of Science in Analytics degree at Georgia Tech and a professor in Georgia Tech's Stewart School of ISYE.
  - In my research and consulting, I've used analytics in a lot of different ways to help a lot of different people.
  - In almost all of that work, a critical key to success has been analytics modeling.

## Descriptive analytics

- Definition (plain): Descriptive analytics tells you what happened.
- Definition (formal): Descriptive analytics summarizes what happened using reporting, aggregation, and visualization.

## Predictive analytics

- Definition (plain): Predictive analytics predicts what will happen.
- Definition (formal): Predictive analytics uses historical data to estimate or forecast unknown outcomes.
- Support (professor phrasing):
  - Analytics can also answer predictive questions, questions that ask what's going to happen in the future.

## Prescriptive analytics

- Definition (plain): Prescriptive analytics tells you what to do to get the best result.
- Definition (formal): Prescriptive analytics recommends actions by optimizing objectives under constraints.
- Support (professor phrasing):
  - On the left is a stream of models, lots of different mathematical approaches to solving analytics problems, machine learning, regression, optimization, and many others sprinkled with examples and situations where they're each valuable.

## Supervised learning

- Definition (plain): You learn from examples where the right answer is already known.
- Definition (formal): Supervised learning learns a mapping from inputs (features) to known outputs (labels) using labeled examples.

## Unsupervised learning

- Definition (plain): You find patterns without being told the right answers.
- Definition (formal): Unsupervised learning finds structure in data without labeled outcomes (e.g., clustering).
